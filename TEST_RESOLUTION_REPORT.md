## 🎯 Initial Problem Analysis

### Test Failure Categories Identified

1. **Fixture Dependency Errors (High Priority)**
   - Missing `mock_aws_context` fixtures causing test failures
   - Inconsistent fixture naming across test files
   - Session-scoped fixture conflicts

2. **Import Path Issues (High Priority)**
   - Module import conflicts in test discovery
   - Missing test dependencies and markers

3. **MCP Protocol Compliance Issues (Medium Priority)**  
   - FastMCP API usage inconsistencies
   - Response format validation failures

4. **Performance Test Timeouts (Low Priority)**
   - Long-running tests exceeding reasonable limits
   - Memory usage pattern analysis failures

- ✅ Enhanced pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Eliminated circular import issues

**Files Modified**:
- `src/cloudwan-mcp-server/pyproject.toml` - Complete marker definitions
- Various test files - Import path standardization

#### **Agent 3: Protocol Compliance Specialist** 
**Focus**: MCP protocol implementation and response format consistency

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Fixed FastMCP API usage patterns (`await mcp.list_tools()`)
- ✅ Standardized JSON response parsing across all tests
- ✅ Enhanced MCP protocol compliance validation
- ✅ Improved error handling patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/integration/test_aws_labs_compliance.py` - MCP protocol fixes
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_server.py` - Response format standardization

#### **Agent 4: Performance/Integration Specialist**
**Focus**: Test performance optimization and timeout management

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Implemented reasonable timeout strategies for long-running tests
- ✅ Enhanced memory usage monitoring with proper cleanup
- ✅ Optimized test execution order for better reliability
- ✅ Added performance regression detection

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Core Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Centralized Fixture Architecture**
```python
# Enhanced conftest.py with session-scoped fixtures
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def mock_aws_context():
    """Session-scoped AWS context for all tests"""
    return AWSTestContext()

@pytest.fixture(scope="session") 
def secure_aws_credentials():
    """Enterprise-grade test credential management"""
    return get_secure_test_credentials("pytest-session")
```

#### 2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
```python
# Before (causing failures)
assert hasattr(mcp, 'tools'), "MCP server must expose tools property"

# After (compliant with FastMCP)
assert hasattr(mcp, 'list_tools'), "MCP server must expose list_tools method"
tools = await mcp.list_tools()
assert len(tools) >= 10, f"Must have at least 10 core CloudWAN tools"
```

#### 3. **Response Format Standardization** 
```python
# Consistent JSON parsing pattern applied across all tests
result = await function_under_test()
parsed = json.loads(result)
assert parsed['success'] is True
assert 'data' in parsed or 'error' in parsed
```

### Security & Compliance Preservation

All fixes maintained:
- ✅ **AWS Labs coding standards** and patterns
- ✅ **Security credential sanitization** in all test scenarios
- ✅ **Enterprise compliance** requirements (SOC 2, GDPR)
- ✅ **Multi-threading safety** in concurrent test execution
