"""Unit tests for the unified_sql_tools module.

These tests verify the functionality of the unified SQL interface tools, including:
- Executing SQL queries on session-based SQLite databases
- Creating temporary tables with custom schemas and data loading
- Handling dynamic table creation with auto-generated table names
- Managing session persistence and database lifecycle
- Error handling for invalid SQL queries and schema mismatches
