# New MCP Server: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

## Summary

### Changes

Created a new MCP server providing comprehensive natural language access to AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) operations. The server includes **103 MCP tools** covering the complete database migration lifecycle from discovery and planning through execution and monitoring.

**Project Components:**
- **103 MCP Tools** organized into 18 functional categories
- **Type-safe implementation** using Pydantic models and FastMCP framework
- **10 specialized manager utilities** for modular architecture
- **Comprehensive documentation** including README, CHANGELOG, and inline documentation
- **Production-ready features**: read-only mode, structured logging, error handling
- **Docker support** with multi-stage builds
- **Complete test suite** with pytest and moto mocking

### User Experience

#### Before
Users managing AWS DMS database migrations had to:
- Use AWS Console for all DMS operations
- Write custom boto3 scripts for automation
- Manually coordinate multi-step migration workflows
- Switch between multiple AWS service consoles
- Maintain separate documentation for procedures
- Use CLI commands with complex parameter syntax

#### After
Users can now interact with AWS DMS entirely through natural language:

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Show me my DMS replication instances"
- "Create a MySQL to PostgreSQL migration task"
- "Test connection between my instance and endpoints"
- "Get table statistics for my running migration"
- "Start a Fleet Advisor database discovery"
- "Generate migration recommendations for my databases"

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
1. **Traditional DMS Operations** (59 tools) - Full CRUD for instances, endpoints, tasks, connections, assessments, certificates, subnet groups, events, maintenance
2. **DMS Serverless** (25 tools) - Complete serverless workflow including projects, providers, profiles, configurations, and migrations
3. **Schema Conversion** (15 tools) - Metadata model operations for database schema transformation
4. **Database Discovery** (9 tools) - Fleet Advisor automated database discovery and analysis
5. **Smart Recommendations** (4 tools) - AI-powered migration optimization suggestions

Users accomplish complex multi-step migrations through conversational commands without switching contexts or writing code.
