# AWS Deadline Cloud MCP Server

> ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR AGENTS
>
> You are solely responsible for the actions and permissions of agents using the MCP server.
>
> - The MCP server operates with the permissions of your configured AWS credentials.
> - Always follow the **principle of least privilege**—grant only the permissions necessary for the agent to function.
> - Carefully validate any instructions generated by your LLM before execution, especially for job submissions.
> - With AWS Deadline Cloud MCP Server, we recommend exercising caution when integrating it into automated workflows.
>
> Misconfigured permissions or unverified agent actions may result in **unexpected costs, failed jobs, or unintended resource usage**.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AWS Deadline Cloud that enables AI assistants to interact with render farms, submit jobs, and manage cloud-based rendering workflows.

📖 **[Complete MCP Guide](https://github.com/aws-deadline/deadline-cloud/blob/mainline/docs/mcp_guide.md)** | 🤖 **[AI Agents Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/latest/developerguide/ai-agents.html)**

## Overview

The AWS Deadline Cloud MCP Server provides AI assistants with natural language access to AWS Deadline Cloud services. This enables seamless integration of render farm management, job submission, and workflow orchestration into AI-powered development environments and chatbots.

## Features

- **Farm Management**: List and explore AWS Deadline Cloud farms and their configurations
- **Queue Operations**: Manage render queues, view status, and configure queue settings
- **Job Lifecycle**: Submit Open Job Description (OpenJD) job bundles, monitor job progress, and retrieve results
- **Fleet Management**: View and manage worker fleets for rendering workloads
- **Storage Integration**: Access storage profiles and manage job attachments
- **Session Monitoring**: Retrieve CloudWatch logs and session details for troubleshooting
- **Output Management**: Download rendered outputs and job artifacts
- **Authentication Support**: Seamless integration with AWS credentials and Deadline Cloud monitor authentication

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.8 or later
2. Install the AWS Deadline Cloud client with MCP support:
   ```bash
   pip install 'deadline[mcp]'
   ```
3. Set up AWS credentials with access to AWS Deadline Cloud services
   - Configure AWS credentials with `aws configure` or environment variables
   - Or use Deadline Cloud monitor credentials: `deadline auth login`
4. Verify authentication: `deadline auth status`

## Setup

### Installation

Configure the MCP server in your MCP client configuration (e.g., for Kiro, edit `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` or create a custom agent in `.kiro/agents/my-deadline-agent.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deadline-cloud": {
      "command": "deadline",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative MCP Client Configurations

#### Kiro (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deadline-cloud": {
      "command": "deadline",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Kiro Custom Agent (`.kiro/agents/my-deadline-agent.json`)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deadline-cloud": {
      "command": "deadline",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using pipx
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deadline-cloud": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": ["run", "deadline[mcp]", "mcp-server"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

| Prompt | Description |

| `List all my AWS Deadline Cloud farms` | Retrieves all available farms in your AWS account |
| `Show me the queues in my farm` | Displays render queues and their current status |
| `List the jobs in my queue` | Shows all jobs in a specific queue with their status |
| `Submit the render job in /path/to/my-job-bundle` | Submits an Open Job Description job bundle for rendering |
| `Submit a job with priority 80 to my render queue` | Submits a job with custom priority settings |
| `Show me the status of job job-3a907bac684841f69fc344867ee166de` | Retrieves detailed status information for a specific job |
| `Get the logs for session session-abc123 to see why my task failed` | Fetches CloudWatch logs for troubleshooting failed tasks |
| `Download output from job job-3a907bac684841f69fc344867ee166de` | Downloads rendered outputs and job artifacts |
| `List fleets in my farm` | Shows available worker fleets and their capacity |
| `Show storage profiles for my queue` | Displays configured storage profiles and their settings |

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides access to AWS Deadline Cloud operations through the following tools:

### Farm & Queue Management
- `deadline_list_farms()`: List available farms
- `deadline_list_queues()`: List queues in a farm
- `deadline_list_fleets()`: List fleets in a farm
- `deadline_list_storage_profiles_for_queue()`: List storage profiles for a queue

### Job Operations
- `deadline_list_jobs()`: List jobs in a queue
- `deadline_submit_job()`: Submit an Open Job Description job bundle to AWS Deadline Cloud
- `deadline_download_job_output()`: Download job output files from AWS Deadline Cloud

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting
- `deadline_check_authentication_status()`: Check current authentication status
- `deadline_get_session_logs()`: Get CloudWatch logs for a specific session

## Security Considerations

When using this MCP server, consider:

- The MCP server operates with the permissions of your configured AWS credentials
- Ensure your IAM user/role has appropriate Deadline Cloud permissions
- Use separate AWS profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Monitor job submissions and costs through AWS billing dashboards
- Validate job bundles and parameters before submission
- Follow your organization's security policies for cloud resource usage

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: Run `deadline auth status` to verify your credentials
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary Deadline Cloud permissions
- **Job Submission Failures**: Verify job bundle format and required parameters
- **Network Issues**: Check AWS service availability and network connectivity
- **For general AWS Deadline Cloud issues**: Consult the [AWS Deadline Cloud documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/)
