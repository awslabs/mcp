# Cell-Based Architecture MCP Server - CICD & Observability Enhancements

## Summary of Enhancements

The Cell-Based Architecture MCP Server has been successfully enhanced with comprehensive CICD pipeline and observability content based on the provided `cicd-pipeline-for-cell-based.txt` document. These enhancements maintain the server's simplicity while adding crucial practical guidance for implementing robust deployment and monitoring strategies.

## Key Enhancements Completed

### 1. Enhanced Knowledge Base
- **CICD Pipeline Implementation** (`knowledge/implementation/cicd-pipeline.md`)
- **Observability Integration** (`knowledge/implementation/observability-integration.md`) 
- **Deployment Checklist** (`knowledge/best-practices/deployment-checklist.md`)

### 2. New Server Capabilities (Framework Ready)
- **get-cicd-guidance**: Architecture-specific CICD pipeline guidance
- **validate-observability-setup**: Observability validation against cell requirements
- **deployment-checklist**: Comprehensive deployment and observability checklist

### 3. Enhanced Resources
- **best-practices**: Now includes CICD and observability practices
- **implementation-patterns**: Enhanced with deployment strategies

## Core Content Integrated

### Wave-Based Deployment Strategy
```
Wave 1: 1 cell (canary) → Bake time → Monitor
Wave 2: 10% of cells → Bake time → Monitor
Wave 3: 50% of cells → Bake time → Monitor
Wave 4: Remaining cells → Final validation
```

### Cell-Aware Observability Requirements
Every log, metric, and trace must include:
- `cell_id`: Unique cell identifier
- `availability_zone`: AZ information
- `region`: AWS region
- `service_version`: Deployed version per cell

### Architecture-Specific Guidance

#### Single-AZ Applications
- Deploy cell by cell within AZ
- Monitor cell health between deployments
- Individual cell fault isolation

#### Multi-AZ Applications
- Coordinate deployment across AZs
- Maintain AZ independence
- Cross-AZ health validation

#### Serverless Applications
- Lambda function versioning per cell
- API Gateway stage management
- Event-driven deployment triggers

#### Kubernetes (EKS) Applications
- Namespace-based cell isolation
- Rolling updates with pod disruption budgets
- Service mesh traffic management

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rates > 1%
- Latency increases > 20%
- Health check failures
- Resource exhaustion alerts

## Observability Enhancements

### Structured Logging Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:15:30Z",
  "cell_id": "cell-us-east-1-a",
  "availability_zone": "us-east-1a",
  "service": "payment-service",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Payment processed successfully",
  "cell_metadata": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "cell_capacity": "100%",
    "cell_health": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### CloudWatch EMF Format
```json
{
  "_aws": {
    "CloudWatchMetrics": [{
      "Namespace": "CellBasedArchitecture/Health",
      "Dimensions": [["CellId"], ["AvailabilityZone"]],
      "Metrics": [{"Name": "CellHealthStatus", "Unit": "None"}]
    }]
  },
  "CellId": "cell-us-east-1-a",
  "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a",
  "CellHealthStatus": 1
}
```

### Hierarchical Alerting Strategy
- **Cell-Level Alarms**: Error rates, latency, resource utilization per cell
- **Zone-Level Alarms**: Multiple cells degraded, cross-AZ latency spikes
- **Customer-Level Monitoring**: Per-customer resource consumption and quotas

## Deployment and Observability Checklist
