# Cell-Based Architecture Anti-Patterns

## Overview

This document outlines common anti-patterns to avoid when implementing cell-based architectures. Learning from these mistakes can save significant time and prevent architectural issues.

## Cross-Cell Dependencies

### The Problem
Creating dependencies between cells that violate isolation principles.

#### Examples of Cross-Cell Dependencies
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Cross-cell database queries
def get_customer_orders(customer_id):
    customer_cell = get_customer_cell(customer_id)
    
    # BAD: Querying other cells for related data
    all_orders = []
    for cell_id in get_all_cells():
        if cell_id != customer_cell:
            orders = query_cell_database(cell_id, customer_id)
            all_orders.extend(orders)
    
    return all_orders

# ANTI-PATTERN: Cross-cell synchronous calls
def process_payment(payment_request):
    customer_cell = get_customer_cell(payment_request.customer_id)
    
    # BAD: Calling other cells synchronously
    inventory_cell = get_inventory_cell(payment_request.product_id)
    inventory_service = get_cell_service(inventory_cell, 'inventory')
    
    # This creates tight coupling between cells
    inventory_check = inventory_service.check_availability(payment_request.product_id)
    
    if inventory_check.available:
        return process_in_cell(customer_cell, payment_request)
```

#### Why It's Bad
- **Blast radius expansion** - Failures cascade across cells
- **Performance degradation** - Network latency between cells
- **Complexity increase** - Difficult to reason about system behavior
- **Scaling limitations** - Cannot scale cells independently

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Self-contained cell processing
def process_payment(payment_request):
    customer_cell = get_customer_cell(payment_request.customer_id)
    
    # All required data should be available within the cell
    return process_payment_in_cell(customer_cell, payment_request)

# GOOD: Eventual consistency through events
def handle_inventory_update(inventory_event):
    # Replicate necessary inventory data to customer cells
    affected_cells = get_cells_for_product(inventory_event.product_id)
    
    for cell_id in affected_cells:
        replicate_inventory_data(cell_id, inventory_event)
```

## Shared State Between Cells

### The Problem
Sharing databases, caches, or other stateful components between cells.

#### Examples of Shared State
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Shared database across cells
class CustomerService:
    def __init__(self):
        # BAD: All cells share the same database
        self.shared_db = connect_to_database("shared-customer-db")
    
    def get_customer(self, customer_id):
        # This creates a shared dependency
        return self.shared_db.query(f"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = {customer_id}")

# ANTI-PATTERN: Shared cache across cells
class CacheService:
    def __init__(self):
        # BAD: Shared Redis cluster across all cells
        self.shared_cache = redis.Redis(host='shared-cache-cluster')
    
    def get_cached_data(self, key):
        return self.shared_cache.get(key)
```

#### Why It's Bad
- **Single point of failure** - Shared component failure affects all cells
- **Scaling bottleneck** - Shared resources become bottlenecks
- **Blast radius violation** - Issues propagate across all cells
- **Operational complexity** - Harder to manage and troubleshoot

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Cell-specific databases
class CustomerService:
    def __init__(self, cell_id):
        # Each cell has its own database
        self.cell_db = connect_to_database(f"customer-db-{cell_id}")
        self.cell_id = cell_id
    
    def get_customer(self, customer_id):
        return self.cell_db.query(f"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = {customer_id}")

# GOOD: Cell-specific caches
class CacheService:
    def __init__(self, cell_id):
        # Each cell has its own cache instance
        self.cell_cache = redis.Redis(host=f'cache-{cell_id}')
        self.cell_id = cell_id
```

## Inadequate Cell Sizing

### The Problem
Cells that are too large or too small for their intended purpose.

#### Too Large Cells
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Oversized cells
CELL_CONFIG = {
    'max_customers': 100000,  # Too many customers per cell
    'max_tps': 50000,         # Too high throughput per cell
    'max_storage': '10TB'     # Too much data per cell
}

# Problems this creates:
def deploy_cell_update():
    # Takes too long to deploy
    # Affects too many customers
    # Hard to test at full scale
    # Resource limits hit frequently
    pass
```

#### Too Small Cells
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Undersized cells
CELL_CONFIG = {
    'max_customers': 10,      # Too few customers per cell
    'max_tps': 100,           # Too low throughput per cell
    'max_storage': '1GB'      # Too little data per cell
}

# Problems this creates:
def manage_system():
    # Too many cells to manage (1000+ cells)
    # High operational overhead
    # Poor resource utilization
    # Expensive infrastructure costs
    pass
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Right-sized cells based on testing and requirements
CELL_CONFIG = {
    'max_customers': 1000,    # Tested and validated limit
    'max_tps': 5000,          # Within service limits
    'max_storage': '100GB',   # Manageable data size
    'target_utilization': 0.7 # Leave headroom for spikes
}

def validate_cell_sizing():
    # Regular load testing to validate limits
    # Monitor actual vs theoretical capacity
    # Adjust sizing based on real-world data
    pass
```

## Inadequate Routing Layer

### The Problem
Cell routers that are too complex, unreliable, or become bottlenecks.

#### Complex Router Logic
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Complex business logic in router
def route_request(request):
    customer_id = request.customer_id
    
    # BAD: Complex business logic in router
    customer = get_customer_details(customer_id)  # External call
    
    if customer.tier == 'premium':
        if customer.region == 'us-east':
            if customer.account_balance > 1000:
                return route_to_premium_cell(request)
            else:
                return route_to_standard_cell(request)
        else:
            return route_to_regional_cell(customer.region, request)
    
    # More complex logic...
    return calculate_optimal_cell(customer, request)
```

#### Unreliable Router
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Router with single points of failure
class CellRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        # BAD: Single database instance for routing
        self.routing_db = connect_to_single_db()
        # BAD: No fallback routing logic
        self.fallback_enabled = False
    
    def route_request(self, request):
        try:
            return self.routing_db.get_cell_for_customer(request.customer_id)
        except DatabaseException:
            # BAD: No fallback, request fails
            raise RoutingException("Cannot route request")
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Simple, reliable router
class CellRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Highly available routing data
        self.routing_cache = setup_distributed_cache()
        self.fallback_enabled = True
    
    def route_request(self, request):
        try:
            # Simple lookup with caching
            return self.routing_cache.get_cell(request.customer_id)
        except Exception:
            # Fallback to hash-based routing
            return self.hash_based_fallback(request.customer_id)
    
    def hash_based_fallback(self, customer_id):
        # Simple, stateless fallback
        hash_value = hash(customer_id)
        return f"cell-{hash_value % self.cell_count}"
```

## Insufficient Observability

### The Problem
Lack of cell-aware monitoring and observability.

#### Non-Cell-Aware Monitoring
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: System-wide metrics without cell context
def log_request(request, response):
    # BAD: No cell information in logs
    logger.info(f"Processed request {request.id} in {response.duration}ms")

def emit_metrics(request_count, error_count):
    # BAD: Aggregate metrics without cell breakdown
    cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
        Namespace='MyApplication',
        MetricData=[
            {
                'MetricName': 'RequestCount',
                'Value': request_count
            }
        ]
    )
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Cell-aware observability
def log_request(request, response, cell_id):
    # Include cell context in all logs
    logger.info(
        f"Processed request {request.id} in cell {cell_id} in {response.duration}ms",
        extra={
            'cell_id': cell_id,
            'customer_id': request.customer_id,
            'request_id': request.id,
            'duration_ms': response.duration
        }
    )

def emit_cell_metrics(cell_id, request_count, error_count):
    # Cell-specific metrics
    cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
        Namespace='MyApplication/Cells',
        MetricData=[
            {
                'MetricName': 'RequestCount',
                'Dimensions': [{'Name': 'CellId', 'Value': cell_id}],
                'Value': request_count
            }
        ]
    )
```

## Premature Cell Splitting

### The Problem
Creating too many cells too early without understanding actual requirements.

#### Over-Engineering Early
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Complex cell hierarchy from day one
INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE = {
    'regions': ['us-east', 'us-west', 'eu-west'],
    'tiers': ['free', 'premium', 'enterprise'],
    'cell_types': ['compute', 'storage', 'analytics'],
    'total_cells': 27  # 3 * 3 * 3 = too many for initial deployment
}

def create_initial_deployment():
    # BAD: Creating complex structure before understanding needs
    for region in INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE['regions']:
        for tier in INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE['tiers']:
            for cell_type in INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE['cell_types']:
                create_cell(f"{region}-{tier}-{cell_type}")
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Start simple and evolve
INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE = {
    'cells': ['cell-001', 'cell-002', 'cell-003'],  # Start with 3 cells
    'capacity_per_cell': 1000,
    'growth_plan': 'add_cells_as_needed'
}

def create_initial_deployment():
    # Start with minimum viable cell count
    for cell_id in INITIAL_CELL_STRUCTURE['cells']:
        create_cell(cell_id)
    
    # Plan for growth but don't over-engineer initially
    setup_cell_scaling_automation()
```

## Ignoring Cell Migration

### The Problem
Not planning for cell migration from the beginning.

#### No Migration Strategy
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Hard-coded cell assignments
class CustomerService:
    def __init__(self):
        # BAD: No way to migrate customers between cells
        self.customer_cell_mapping = {
            'customer-1': 'cell-001',
            'customer-2': 'cell-001',
            'customer-3': 'cell-002'
            # Hard-coded mappings with no migration capability
        }
    
    def get_customer_cell(self, customer_id):
        return self.customer_cell_mapping.get(customer_id, 'cell-001')
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Migration-aware design from day one
class CustomerService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Flexible routing with migration support
        self.routing_service = CellRoutingService()
        self.migration_service = CellMigrationService()
    
    def get_customer_cell(self, customer_id):
        # Check for active migrations
        if self.migration_service.is_customer_migrating(customer_id):
            return self.migration_service.get_migration_target(customer_id)
        
        return self.routing_service.get_customer_cell(customer_id)
    
    def migrate_customer(self, customer_id, target_cell):
        return self.migration_service.migrate_customer(customer_id, target_cell)
```

## Inadequate Testing

### The Problem
Not testing cell-specific scenarios and failure modes.

#### System-Level Testing Only
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Only testing the whole system
def test_application():
    # BAD: Only testing system-wide functionality
    response = make_request('/api/customers/123')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    
    # No cell-specific testing
    # No cell failure testing
    # No cell migration testing
```

#### Better Approach
```python
# GOOD: Comprehensive cell-aware testing
def test_cell_isolation():
    # Test that cell failures don't affect other cells
    disable_cell('cell-001')
    
    # Customers in other cells should be unaffected
    response = make_request_to_cell('cell-002', '/api/customers/456')
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_cell_migration():
    # Test customer migration between cells
    customer_id = 'customer-123'
    source_cell = get_customer_cell(customer_id)
    target_cell = 'cell-003'
    
    migrate_customer(customer_id, source_cell, target_cell)
    
    # Verify customer can be accessed in new cell
    response = make_request(f'/api/customers/{customer_id}')
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_cell_capacity_limits():
    # Test cell behavior at capacity limits
    cell_id = 'cell-001'
    
    # Load cell to capacity
    load_cell_to_capacity(cell_id)
    
    # Verify graceful degradation
    response = make_request_to_cell(cell_id, '/api/test')
    assert response.status_code in [200, 429]  # Success or rate limited
```
