# Deployment and Observability Checklist

## Deployment-Related Questions

### 1. Fault Isolation Boundary Alignment
**Question**: Is your deployment model aligned with your fault isolation boundaries?

**Best Practice**: The deployment model must be strictly aligned with fault isolation boundaries to ensure system reliability. If you have a cell serving customers in the US-East region, your deployment process should treat this cell as an independent unit.

**Example**: Deploy to a specific cell without affecting other cells in US-West or Europe. This alignment helps contain potential issues within a single cell, preventing system-wide failures.

### 2. Gradual Cell Deployment
**Question**: Are you able to effectively deploy a change gradually cell per cell in a service?

**Best Practice**: Implement gradual cell-by-cell deployment for risk management and service reliability.

**Example**: 
- Start with 1 cell (5% traffic) → Monitor 24-48 hours
- Expand to 10% of cells → Monitor performance
- Roll out to 50% of cells → Validate stability
- Complete deployment to remaining cells

### 3. Cell Onboarding Process
**Question**: How are new cells onboarded to your application?

**Best Practice**: Follow a well-defined, automated process including:
- Automated infrastructure provisioning (CloudFormation/Terraform)
- Security configuration and networking setup
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Validation steps (load testing, security scanning)

### 4. Customer-Specific Cell Support
**Question**: Can you support a specific customer per cell?

**Best Practice**: Configure dedicated cells for enterprise customers requiring:
- Specific resource allocations
- Custom security controls
- Isolated monitoring
- Compliance requirements

### 5. Cell Balancing and Migration
**Question**: How do you balance cell sizes and move clients between them?

**Best Practice**: Implement automated balancing with:
- Clear capacity metrics (80% threshold triggers rebalancing)
- Gradual traffic shifting using DNS/load balancer
- Zero-downtime migration processes
- Consideration of usage patterns and time zones

### 6. Automatic Rollback Capabilities
**Question**: Can you automatically rollback changes that cause failures?

**Best Practice**: Implement automated rollback when:
- Error rates spike above 1%
- Latency increases beyond thresholds
- Health checks fail
- Resource exhaustion occurs

### 7. Cell Limit Testing
**Question**: Do you test your cell limits in your deployment pipeline?

**Best Practice**: Include automated tests that:
- Simulate maximum load conditions
- Verify performance at designed capacity (e.g., 10,000 RPS)
- Test graceful degradation beyond limits
- Validate resource constraints

## Observability-Related Questions

### 1. Observability Boundary Alignment
**Question**: Is your observability model aligned with your fault isolation boundaries?

**Best Practice**: Each cell should have comprehensive metrics, logs, and traces tagged with:
- `cell_id`: Unique cell identifier
- `availability_zone`: AZ information
- `region`: AWS region
- `service_version`: Deployed version

### 2. Single Cell Health Monitoring
**Question**: Are you able to effectively monitor the operational health of a single cell?

**Best Practice**: Implement comprehensive cell health monitoring:
- Real-time health indicators per cell
- Error rates, latency, throughput metrics
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Drill-down capabilities for specific services

### 3. Customer Behavior Analysis
**Question**: How are you capturing and displaying metric data for specific customers by cell?

**Best Practice**: Implement customer-specific metrics:
- Tag transactions with customer ID and cell ID
- Generate per-customer performance reports
- Visualize usage trends and resource consumption
- Create customized dashboards per customer

### 4. Cell Identifier Propagation
**Question**: Are you generating logs, metrics, tracing with the cell identifier?

**Best Practice**: Every observability event must include cell context:

**Log Example**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-09T10:15:30Z",
  "cell_id": "cell-us-east-1-a",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Payment processed",
  "customer_id": "cust-123"
}
```

**Trace Example**:
```json
{
  "trace_id": "1-5759e988-bd862e3fe1be46a994272793",
  "cell_context": {
    "cell_id": "cell-us-east-1-a",
    "availability_zone": "us-east-1a"
  }
}
```

### 5. Hierarchical Alerting
**Question**: Are there alarms and aggregated alarms by zone and by cell?

**Best Practice**: Implement hierarchical alarm system:

**Cell-Level Alarms**:
- Error rates > 1% per cell
- Latency P99 > 500ms per cell
- Resource utilization > 80% per cell

**Zone-Level Alarms**:
- Multiple cells in AZ showing degradation
- Cross-AZ latency spikes
- AZ-wide infrastructure issues

### 6. Cell Limits and Dimensions
**Question**: Do you have cell limits/dimensions established and with alarms?

**Best Practice**: Define and monitor cell limits:
- Maximum concurrent connections: 5,000
- Request rate limits: 10,000 RPS
- Memory usage: 80% threshold
- CPU utilization: 75% threshold

**Graduated Alarms**:
- 70% utilization: Warning
- 85% utilization: Critical
- 95% utilization: Emergency

### 7. Customer Limits Within Cells
**Question**: Do you have customer limits/dimensions inside the cell established and with alarms?

**Best Practice**: Establish per-customer quotas:
- API call limits: 1,000 requests/minute per customer
- Storage quotas: 10GB per customer
- Compute resource limits: 100 CPU units per customer

**Enforcement**:
- Alert at 80% of customer quota
- Implement throttling at 100% quota
- Protect cell health from noisy neighbors

### 8. Resource Consumption Measurement
**Question**: How do you measure the resource consumption of individual cells and customers?

**Best Practice**: Implement comprehensive resource tracking:
- CPU, memory, network I/O, storage per cell
- Per-customer resource attribution within cells
- Historical usage trends and patterns
- Cost allocation and chargeback capabilities

**Tools**:
- AWS CloudWatch for metrics collection
- Custom dashboards for visualization
- Automated reporting for capacity planning
- Real-time alerts for resource exhaustion
