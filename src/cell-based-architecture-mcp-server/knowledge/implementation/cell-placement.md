# Cell Placement

## Overview

Cell placement is a control plane responsibility that refers to the activities of onboarding new tenants and customers, as well as creating the cells themselves. Effective placement requires comprehensive observability and strategic decision-making.

## Required Observability

To make effective placement decisions, monitor:

### Capacity Metrics
- **Capacity of each cell** - Maximum theoretical capacity
- **Used capacity of each cell** - Current utilization levels
- **Percentage of usage** of each tenant or customer
- **Quotas and limits** of each cell in their respective AWS account

### Performance Indicators
- Response time per cell
- Error rates per cell
- Throughput patterns
- Resource utilization trends

## Placement Strategy

### Optimal Utilization
Find the percentage of utilization and limit where each cell operates with:
- **Greatest possible predictability**
- **Maximum stability**
- **Sufficient headroom for failover**

### Headroom Considerations
As recommended in REL01-BP06: "Ensure sufficient gap exists between current quotas and maximum usage to accommodate failover."

- Don't operate constantly at threshold limits
- Maintain buffer for traffic spikes
- Account for failover scenarios
- Consider seasonal variations

## Placement Scenarios

### New Customer Onboarding
1. **Evaluate customer requirements**
   - Expected traffic patterns
   - Data volume requirements
   - Geographic preferences
   - Compliance requirements

2. **Select optimal cell**
   - Available capacity
   - Geographic proximity
   - Compliance alignment
   - Load distribution

3. **Configure routing**
   - Update cell router mapping
   - Validate routing configuration
   - Monitor placement success

### Cell Creation
1. **Capacity planning**
   - Forecast demand growth
   - Identify capacity gaps
   - Plan cell deployment timeline

2. **Resource provisioning**
   - Deploy cell infrastructure
   - Configure monitoring and alerting
   - Validate cell health

3. **Integration**
   - Register cell with router
   - Update placement algorithms
   - Begin accepting traffic

## Placement Algorithms

### Even Distribution
Distribute customers evenly across available cells:

```python
def select_cell_even_distribution(cells, customer_load):
    # Sort cells by current utilization
    sorted_cells = sorted(cells, key=lambda c: c.utilization)
    
    # Select cell with lowest utilization
    for cell in sorted_cells:
        if cell.available_capacity >= customer_load:
            return cell
    
    # No cell has sufficient capacity
    return None
```

### Affinity-Based Placement
Consider customer relationships and data locality:

```python
def select_cell_with_affinity(cells, customer, related_customers):
    # Prefer cells with related customers
    for cell in cells:
        if any(related in cell.customers for related in related_customers):
            if cell.available_capacity >= customer.expected_load:
                return cell
    
    # Fall back to even distribution
    return select_cell_even_distribution(cells, customer.expected_load)
```

### Geographic Placement
Consider latency and compliance requirements:

```python
def select_cell_geographic(cells, customer_location, compliance_requirements):
    # Filter cells by compliance requirements
    compliant_cells = [c for c in cells if c.meets_compliance(compliance_requirements)]
    
    # Sort by geographic proximity
    sorted_cells = sorted(compliant_cells, 
                         key=lambda c: distance(c.location, customer_location))
    
    # Select closest cell with capacity
    for cell in sorted_cells:
        if cell.available_capacity >= customer.expected_load:
            return cell
    
    return None
```

## Dynamic Placement Scenarios

### Customer Growth
When existing customers outgrow their current cell:

1. **Identify growth patterns**
   - Monitor customer usage trends
   - Predict future capacity needs
   - Identify customers approaching cell limits

2. **Migration planning**
   - Select target cell with sufficient capacity
   - Plan migration timeline
   - Coordinate with customer if needed

3. **Execute migration**
   - Use cell migration mechanisms
   - Monitor migration progress
   - Validate successful completion

### Cell Rebalancing
When cells become unbalanced:

1. **Detect imbalance**
   - Monitor utilization across cells
   - Identify overloaded and underutilized cells
   - Calculate optimal distribution

2. **Plan rebalancing**
   - Select customers for migration
   - Choose target cells
   - Minimize customer impact

3. **Execute rebalancing**
   - Migrate customers gradually
   - Monitor system stability
   - Validate improved distribution

## Placement Considerations

### Data and State Heavy Workloads
For workloads with significant data requirements:

- **Allocation becomes core competency**
- **Deep area of scheduling and forecasting**
- **Strategy to evenly distribute traffic**
- **Consider data migration costs**

### Key Factors
- **Cell dimensions** - May change over time or be fixed
- **Partition key dimensions** - Changes over time
- **Migration cost** - Cost of moving partition keys between cells
- **Co-tenancy benefits** - Affinity between certain partition keys

### Cost Optimization
- **Resource utilization** - Maximize cell efficiency
- **Migration costs** - Minimize unnecessary moves
- **Operational overhead** - Balance automation vs manual intervention
- **SLA compliance** - Ensure placement meets performance requirements

## Automation and Tooling

### Automated Placement
- **Rule-based systems** - Codify placement policies
- **Machine learning** - Predict optimal placement
- **Policy engines** - Enforce compliance and business rules
- **Integration APIs** - Automate customer onboarding

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Capacity alerts** - Warn when cells approach limits
- **Imbalance detection** - Identify uneven distribution
- **Performance monitoring** - Track placement effectiveness
- **Cost tracking** - Monitor placement efficiency

### Placement Validation
- **Health checks** - Verify successful placement
- **Performance testing** - Validate placement decisions
- **Rollback capabilities** - Handle placement failures
- **Audit trails** - Track placement decisions and outcomes
