# Cell Observability

## Overview

Cell-based architecture requires specialized observability approaches. If you previously had one stack to monitor, you now have many stacks, and to take advantage of all the benefits of cell-based architecture, your entire observability stack needs to be cell-aware.

## Cell-Aware Observability

### Core Requirements
- **Individual cell visibility** - Observe each cell independently
- **Request tracking** - Track each request and identify its destination cell
- **Aggregated views** - Roll up metrics across cells for system-wide visibility
- **Cell comparison** - Compare performance across cells to identify outliers

### Observability Dimensions
- **Per-cell metrics** - Individual cell performance and health
- **Cross-cell metrics** - System-wide aggregations and comparisons
- **Cell router metrics** - Routing layer performance and distribution
- **Customer journey** - Track customer requests across cell boundaries

## Dashboard Design

### Cell-Level Dashboards
Create dashboards that provide visibility into individual cells:

#### Key Metrics per Cell
- **Request volume** - Requests per second per cell
- **Response times** - Latency percentiles per cell
- **Error rates** - Error percentage per cell
- **Resource utilization** - CPU, memory, storage per cell
- **Capacity utilization** - Current load vs cell capacity

#### Cell Health Indicators
- **Availability** - Cell uptime and availability percentage
- **Performance** - Response time trends and SLA compliance
- **Capacity** - Current utilization vs limits
- **Dependencies** - Health of cell dependencies

### System-Level Dashboards
Provide aggregated views across all cells:

#### System-Wide Metrics
- **Total request volume** - Aggregate requests across all cells
- **Overall availability** - System-wide availability calculation
- **Cell distribution** - Request distribution across cells
- **Performance comparison** - Compare cell performance metrics

#### Operational Metrics
- **Cell count** - Number of active cells
- **Deployment status** - Deployment progress across cells
- **Migration activity** - Active cell migrations
- **Capacity planning** - System-wide capacity trends

## Request Tracking

### Distributed Tracing
Implement distributed tracing to track requests across cell boundaries:

#### Trace Components
- **Cell router span** - Routing decision and forwarding
- **Cell processing span** - Request processing within cell
- **Cross-cell spans** - Any cross-cell communication
- **External service spans** - Calls to external services

#### Trace Correlation
- **Correlation IDs** - Unique identifiers for request tracking
- **Cell identification** - Tag traces with cell information
- **Customer identification** - Associate traces with customers
- **Service mapping** - Understand service dependencies

### Logging Strategy
Implement structured logging with cell context:

#### Log Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-11T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "cell_id": "cell-us-east-1-001",
  "customer_id": "customer-12345",
  "request_id": "req-abcd-1234",
  "response_time_ms": 150,
  "status_code": 200
}
```

#### Log Aggregation
- **Centralized logging** - Aggregate logs from all cells
- **Cell-aware queries** - Filter and search by cell
- **Cross-cell correlation** - Link related log entries
- **Alerting integration** - Generate alerts from log patterns

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Cell-Specific Alerts
Configure alerts for individual cell issues:

#### Performance Alerts
- **High latency** - Response times exceed thresholds
- **High error rates** - Error percentage above acceptable levels
- **Capacity alerts** - Utilization approaching cell limits
- **Availability alerts** - Cell health check failures

#### Operational Alerts
- **Deployment failures** - Failed deployments to cells
- **Migration issues** - Problems during cell migrations
- **Configuration drift** - Cell configuration inconsistencies
- **Resource exhaustion** - Resource limits being approached

### System-Wide Alerts
Monitor overall system health across cells:

#### Aggregate Alerts
- **Overall availability** - System-wide availability drops
- **Performance degradation** - Aggregate performance issues
- **Uneven distribution** - Significant load imbalances
- **Cell failures** - Multiple cell failures

#### Capacity Alerts
- **System capacity** - Overall system approaching limits
- **Cell count** - Need for additional cells
- **Growth trends** - Capacity planning alerts
- **Resource constraints** - System-wide resource issues

## Metrics and KPIs

### Cell Performance Metrics
Track key performance indicators for each cell:

#### Availability Metrics
- **Uptime percentage** - Cell availability over time
- **MTBF** - Mean time between failures per cell
- **MTTR** - Mean time to recovery per cell
- **SLA compliance** - Adherence to service level agreements

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response time percentiles** - P50, P95, P99 response times
- **Throughput** - Requests per second capacity
- **Error rates** - Percentage of failed requests
- **Resource efficiency** - Resource utilization vs performance

### System Metrics
Monitor overall system health and efficiency:

#### Efficiency Metrics
- **Cell utilization** - Average utilization across cells
- **Load distribution** - Evenness of load across cells
- **Resource efficiency** - Overall resource utilization
