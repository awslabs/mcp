# Control Plane and Data Plane

## Overview

AWS separates most services into the concepts of control plane and data plane. These terms come from the world of networking, specifically routers. The router's data plane, which is its main function, is moving packets around based on rules. But the routing policies have to be created and distributed from somewhere, and that's where the control plane comes in.

## Control Plane

Control planes for your cell-based architecture provide the administrative APIs used to:
- **Provision** cells
- **Move** customers between cells
- **Migrate** data between cells
- **Update** cell configurations
- **Remove** cells
- **Deploy** new versions
- **Monitor** cell health

### Control Plane Responsibilities
- Cell lifecycle management
- Customer/tenant placement decisions
- Cell routing configuration updates
- Capacity planning and scaling decisions
- Migration orchestration

## Data Plane

The data plane provides the primary function of the service together with the cell router. This includes:
- **Processing** customer requests
- **Routing** requests to appropriate cells
- **Executing** business logic
- **Returning** responses

### Data Plane Components
- Cell router
- Individual cells
- Request processing logic
- Response handling

## Relationship Example

Imagine you have five cells and the number of users starts growing:

1. **Control plane** is responsible for provisioning a new cell
2. **Control plane** updates the router configuration with new cell information
3. **Data plane** (router and cells) continues processing requests normally

## Static Stability

As recommended in the Well-Architected Framework (REL11-BP04): "Rely on the data plane and not the control plane during recovery."

### Static Stability Principles
- **Data plane continues operating** even when control plane is down
- **Existing resources remain available** during control plane impairment
- **No dependency on control plane** for ongoing request processing
- **Graceful degradation** when control plane is unavailable

### Implementation Considerations
- Data plane maintains existing state during control plane failures
- Cell routing continues with last known good configuration
- New provisioning may be impacted, but existing traffic flows normally
- Recovery operations should primarily use data plane mechanisms

## Failure Probability

Control planes are statistically more likely to fail than data planes because:
- **Complexity** - Control planes handle complex orchestration logic
- **State management** - More complex state transitions and coordination
- **Dependencies** - Often depend on multiple external services
- **Change frequency** - More frequent updates and modifications

Data planes are more reliable because:
- **Simplicity** - Focus on core request processing
- **Stateless design** - Minimal state management requirements
- **Fewer dependencies** - Limited external service dependencies
- **Stable patterns** - Consistent, well-tested code paths
