# Cell Deployment

## Overview

Cell deployment introduces significant complexity compared to traditional single-instance deployments. Instead of deploying one instance of your workload, you now have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of instances to deploy and operate, depending on your cell limits, scale units, and cell size.

## Deployment Complexity

### Scale of Challenge
- **Traditional deployment** - One instance per environment (dev, staging, prod)
- **Cell-based deployment** - Multiple cells across environments, AZs, and Regions
- **Multiplicative complexity** - Each dimension multiplies deployment complexity
- **Coordination requirements** - Need to coordinate across many deployment targets

### Essential Requirements
- **Automated CI/CD pipeline** - Manual deployment becomes impossible at scale
- **Phased deployment strategy** - Deploy incrementally to reduce risk
- **Rollback capabilities** - Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - Visibility into deployment progress and health

## Amazon Service Deployment Model

AWS services follow a phased deployment approach that can be adapted for cell-based architectures:

### Deployment Phases
1. **Internal testing** - Deploy to internal/test environments
2. **Single AZ** - Deploy to one AZ in one Region
3. **Single Region** - Deploy across all AZs in one Region
4. **Multiple Regions** - Gradual rollout across Regions
5. **General availability** - Full deployment to all Regions

### Benefits
- **Risk reduction** - Limit blast radius of deployment issues
- **Early detection** - Identify problems before full rollout
- **Gradual validation** - Validate each phase before proceeding
- **Quick rollback** - Easy to revert if issues are detected

## Cell Deployment Strategy

### Phased Cell Deployment
Deploy cells in waves rather than all at once:

```
Wave 1: Deploy to 1-2 canary cells
Wave 2: Deploy to 10% of cells
Wave 3: Deploy to 50% of cells
Wave 4: Deploy to remaining cells
```

### Deployment Dimensions
Consider multiple deployment dimensions:
- **Environment** - Dev → Staging → Production
- **Geographic** - Region by Region
- **Availability Zone** - AZ by AZ within Region
- **Cell groups** - Logical groupings of cells

### Canary Cells
- **Dedicated canary cells** - Cells specifically for testing deployments
- **Synthetic workloads** - Non-critical traffic for validation
- **Real customer subset** - Small percentage of real traffic
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - Enhanced observability for canary cells

## Deployment Benefits

### Fault Isolation During Deployment
Cell-based architecture provides fault isolation benefits not only during normal operation but also during deployments:

- **Limited blast radius** - Failed deployments affect only subset of cells
- **Customer isolation** - Only customers in affected cells experience issues
- **Quick identification** - Problems are easier to identify and isolate
- **Faster rollback** - Can rollback individual cells rather than entire system

### Deployment Validation
- **Cell-by-cell validation** - Validate each cell deployment individually
- **Health checks** - Automated validation of cell health post-deployment
- **Performance testing** - Validate performance characteristics
- **Customer impact monitoring** - Track customer experience during deployment

## CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Source control** - Code changes trigger pipeline
2. **Build and test** - Compile and run automated tests
3. **Artifact creation** - Create deployment artifacts
4. **Environment promotion** - Deploy through environments
5. **Cell deployment** - Deploy to cells in phases
6. **Validation** - Automated and manual validation
7. **Promotion decision** - Go/no-go for next phase

### AWS Services for CI/CD
- **AWS CodeCommit** - Source control management
- **AWS CodeBuild** - Build and test automation
- **AWS CodePipeline** - Deployment pipeline orchestration
- **AWS CodeDeploy** - Application deployment automation

### Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
# Example pipeline configuration
stages:
  - name: build
    actions:
      - build-and-test
      - create-artifacts
  
  - name: deploy-canary
    actions:
      - deploy-to-canary-cells
      - validate-canary-deployment
  
  - name: deploy-production
    actions:
      - deploy-wave-1
      - validate-wave-1
      - deploy-wave-2
      - validate-wave-2
      - deploy-remaining
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Parallel environments** - Maintain two identical environments
- **Traffic switching** - Switch traffic from blue to green
- **Quick rollback** - Switch back to blue if issues occur
- **Resource overhead** - Requires double the resources during deployment

### Rolling Deployment
- **Incremental updates** - Update cells one at a time or in small batches
- **Continuous availability** - Service remains available during deployment
- **Gradual validation** - Validate each batch before proceeding
- **Longer deployment time** - Takes longer to complete full deployment

### Canary Deployment
- **Small subset first** - Deploy to small percentage of cells
- **Validation period** - Monitor canary cells for issues
- **Gradual expansion** - Increase percentage if validation succeeds
- **Quick rollback** - Easy to revert canary deployment

## Deployment Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Deployment success rate** - Percentage of successful deployments
- **Deployment duration** - Time to complete deployment phases
- **Error rates** - Application errors during and after deployment
- **Performance metrics** - Response time, throughput, resource utilization

### Automated Validation
- **Health checks** - Automated validation of cell health
- **Smoke tests** - Basic functionality validation
- **Performance tests** - Validate performance characteristics
- **Integration tests** - Validate inter-service communication

### Rollback Triggers
- **Error rate thresholds** - Automatic rollback if errors exceed threshold
- **Performance degradation** - Rollback if performance drops significantly
- **Health check failures** - Rollback if health checks fail
- **Manual triggers** - Operator-initiated rollback

## Best Practices

### Well-Architected Framework Alignment
Follow these Well-Architected best practices:
- **REL08-BP05** - Deploy changes with automation
- **OPS05-BP10** - Fully automate integration and deployment
- **OPS06-BP01** - Plan for unsuccessful changes
- **OPS06-BP07** - Fully automate integration and deployment
- **OPS06-BP08** - Automate testing and rollback

### Deployment Principles
- **Automate everything** - Manual deployments don't scale
- **Deploy frequently** - Smaller, more frequent deployments reduce risk
- **Monitor continuously** - Comprehensive observability during deployments
- **Plan for failure** - Always have rollback procedures ready
- **Test thoroughly** - Validate deployments at each phase

### Operational Excellence
- **Runbooks** - Detailed procedures for deployment operations
- **Training** - Ensure team understands deployment procedures
- **Communication** - Clear communication during deployments
- **Post-deployment review** - Learn from each deployment experience

## Deployment Challenges

### Coordination Complexity
- **Multiple teams** - Coordinate across development, operations, and business teams
- **Timing dependencies** - Manage dependencies between cell deployments
- **Resource constraints** - Manage resource utilization during deployments
- **Communication overhead** - Keep all stakeholders informed

### State Management
- **Database migrations** - Coordinate schema changes across cells
- **Configuration updates** - Ensure consistent configuration across cells
- **Feature flags** - Manage feature rollouts across cells
- **Data consistency** - Maintain data consistency during deployments

### Rollback Complexity
- **Partial rollbacks** - Roll back individual cells vs entire deployment
- **State consistency** - Ensure consistent state after rollback
- **Customer impact** - Minimize customer impact during rollback
- **Recovery procedures** - Clear procedures for recovery from failed deployments
