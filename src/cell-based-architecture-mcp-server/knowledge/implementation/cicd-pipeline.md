# CICD Pipeline for Cell-Based Architecture

## Pipeline Architecture

### Three-Tier Pipeline Structure
1. **Cell Components Pipeline** - Updates individual components (ALB, ECS, DynamoDB) across cells
2. **Cell Router Pipeline** - Manages routing layer deployments
3. **Control Plane Pipeline** - Handles cell provisioning and administration

### Wave-Based Deployment Strategy
```
Wave 1: 1 cell (canary) → Bake time → Monitor
Wave 2: 10% of cells → Bake time → Monitor  
Wave 3: 50% of cells → Bake time → Monitor
Wave 4: Remaining cells → Final validation
```

## Deployment Models by Architecture Type

### Single-AZ Applications
- Deploy cell-by-cell within AZ
- Monitor cell health between deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure detection
- Fault isolation boundary: Individual cell

### Multi-AZ Applications
- Coordinate deployment across AZs
- Maintain AZ independence
- Cross-AZ health validation
- Fault isolation boundary: Cell + AZ

### Serverless Applications
- Lambda function versioning per cell
- API Gateway stage management
- DynamoDB zero-downtime updates
- Event-driven deployment triggers

### Kubernetes (EKS) Applications
- Namespace-based cell isolation
- Rolling updates with pod disruption budgets
- Service mesh traffic management
- Helm chart per cell deployment

## Fault Isolation Alignment

### Deployment Pipeline Boundaries
- **AWS Account**: Highest isolation level
- **Region**: Geographic fault isolation
- **Availability Zone**: Infrastructure fault isolation  
- **Cell**: Application-level fault isolation

### Scope of Impact Reduction
- Monolithic: 100% impact on failure
- Microservices: Service-level impact
- Cell-based: Cell-level impact (5-20% of traffic)

## Bake Time and Validation

### One-Box Environments
- Single instance testing before wave deployment
- Synthetic workload validation
- Performance baseline establishment
- Security and compliance checks

### Automated Progression Control
```yaml
deployment_gates:
  error_rate_threshold: 1%
  latency_p99_threshold: 500ms
  bake_time_minutes: 30
  auto_rollback: true
```

## Rollback Strategies

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate exceeds threshold (>1%)
- Latency degradation (>20% increase)
- Health check failures
- Resource exhaustion alerts

### Rollback Limitations
- Database schema changes require careful planning
- Stateful services need data consistency checks
- Cross-cell dependencies may prevent partial rollbacks
- Customer data migration rollbacks are complex

## Configuration Management

### Feature Flags Integration
- Cell-aware feature flag deployment
- Gradual feature rollout per cell
- A/B testing within cell boundaries
- Emergency feature disable capability

### AWS AppConfig Integration
```json
{
  "cell_id": "cell-us-east-1a",
  "feature_flags": {
    "new_payment_flow": true,
    "enhanced_logging": false
  },
  "configuration": {
    "max_connections": 1000,
    "timeout_ms": 5000
  }
}
```

## Multi-Region Considerations

### Regional Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy to single region first
2. Validate cross-region dependencies
3. Gradual rollout to additional regions
4. Monitor inter-region communication

### Data Consistency Challenges
- Cross-region data replication delays
- Eventual consistency considerations
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Regional failover procedures
