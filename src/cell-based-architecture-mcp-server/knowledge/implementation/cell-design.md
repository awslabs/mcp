# Cell Design

## Overview

Cell design is a fundamental aspect of cell-based architecture that determines how individual cells are structured and deployed across AWS infrastructure.

## Multi-AZ Cells

Multi-AZ cells span multiple Availability Zones within a region, providing built-in resilience against AZ-level failures.

### Characteristics
- **Cross-AZ deployment** - Components distributed across multiple AZs
- **AZ-level fault tolerance** - Can survive complete AZ failure
- **Higher availability** - Built-in redundancy at infrastructure level
- **Increased complexity** - More complex networking and data consistency

### Use Cases
- Applications requiring highest availability
- Workloads that cannot tolerate AZ-level outages
- Services with strict SLA requirements
- Critical business applications

### Implementation Considerations
- Load balancing across AZs
- Data replication strategies
- Network latency between AZs
- Cross-AZ data transfer costs

## Single-AZ Cells

Single-AZ cells are contained within a single Availability Zone, providing simpler deployment and operation.

### Characteristics
- **Single AZ deployment** - All components within one AZ
- **Simpler architecture** - Reduced networking complexity
- **Lower latency** - No cross-AZ communication overhead
- **AZ dependency** - Vulnerable to AZ-level failures

### Use Cases
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Workloads with many cells providing redundancy
- Applications where cell-level redundancy compensates for AZ risk
- Development and testing environments

### Implementation Considerations
- Cell placement across multiple AZs
- Sufficient cell count for redundancy
- Monitoring AZ health
- Rapid cell provisioning capabilities

## Should Single-AZ Cells Fail Over?

This is a critical design decision with trade-offs:

### Arguments Against Failover
- **Complexity** - Adds significant architectural complexity
- **State management** - Difficult to maintain consistency during failover
- **Testing challenges** - Hard to test failover scenarios thoroughly
- **Blast radius** - Failed failover can impact multiple cells

### Arguments For Failover
- **Availability** - Provides additional layer of protection
- **Customer experience** - Reduces impact of AZ failures
- **SLA compliance** - May be required for strict availability targets

### Recommended Approach
Instead of complex failover mechanisms:
1. **Design for cell loss** - Architecture should handle cell failures gracefully
2. **Rapid reprovisioning** - Focus on quickly creating new cells
3. **Load redistribution** - Route traffic away from failed cells
4. **Monitoring and alerting** - Detect failures quickly

## Design Principles

### Independence
- Each cell operates independently
- No shared state between cells
- Minimal cross-cell dependencies

### Completeness
- Each cell contains all necessary components
- Self-contained business logic
- Independent data storage

### Consistency
- Standardized cell architecture across deployments
- Consistent resource allocation
- Uniform monitoring and observability

### Scalability
- Cells can be added/removed dynamically
- Horizontal scaling through cell multiplication
- Predictable resource requirements per cell
