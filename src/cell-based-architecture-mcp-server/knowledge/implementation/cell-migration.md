# Cell Migration

## Overview

Cell migration is the process of moving customers, data, or workloads from one cell to another. This capability is essential for maintaining optimal cell utilization, handling customer growth, and managing cell lifecycle operations.

## Core Principles

### No Shared State
Cells should not share state or components between cells. This isolation is fundamental to the migration process and ensures clean separation of concerns.

### Migration Necessity
A cell migration strategy might be needed in several scenarios:
- **Customer growth** - When a customer becomes too large for their current cell
- **Cell rebalancing** - When cells become unbalanced in terms of load
- **Cell maintenance** - When cells need to be updated or replaced
- **Capacity optimization** - When better resource utilization is needed

## Migration Scenarios

### Customer Outgrowth
When a particular customer or resource becomes too big for their current cell:

1. **Detection** - Monitor customer growth patterns
2. **Planning** - Identify target cell with sufficient capacity
3. **Coordination** - Plan migration with minimal customer impact
4. **Execution** - Perform migration using established mechanisms
5. **Validation** - Confirm successful migration and cleanup

### Dedicated Cell Requirements
Some customers may require dedicated cells for:
- **Compliance reasons** - Regulatory requirements
- **Performance guarantees** - SLA commitments
- **Security isolation** - Enhanced security posture
- **Custom configurations** - Specialized requirements

## Online Migration Process

Stateful cell-based architectures almost certainly require online cell migration to adjust placement when cells are added or removed.

### Migration Phases

#### 1. Clone Data
- **Non-authoritative copy** - Create replica in target cell
- **Continuous synchronization** - Keep data in sync during migration
- **Validation** - Ensure data integrity and completeness
- **Monitoring** - Track replication progress and performance

#### 2. Flip Authority
- **Authoritative switch** - Make new location the primary
- **Atomic operation** - Ensure clean transition
- **Rollback capability** - Ability to revert if issues occur
- **Validation** - Confirm successful authority transfer

#### 3. Redirect Traffic
- **Router update** - Update cell routing configuration
- **Gradual transition** - Phase traffic migration if needed
- **Monitoring** - Watch for routing issues or performance problems
- **Validation** - Ensure all traffic reaches new cell

#### 4. Cleanup
- **Data removal** - Delete data from old location
- **Resource cleanup** - Free up resources in source cell
- **Configuration cleanup** - Remove old routing entries
- **Audit trail** - Document migration completion

## Mapping Decisions During Migration

### Transitionary Period Handling
During migration, the system must handle mapping decisions carefully:

#### Cross-Cell Redirects
- **Temporary redirects** - Route requests to new cell location
- **Graceful handling** - Ensure no request failures during transition
- **Timeout management** - Handle redirect timeouts appropriately
- **Error handling** - Manage redirect failures gracefully

#### Multiple Mapping Iterations
- **Version awareness** - Handle different versions of mapping state
- **Fallback mechanisms** - Use previous mapping if new one fails
- **Consistency checks** - Validate mapping state across components
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle mapping conflicts during transition

## Alternative Migration Approach

### Control Plane Coordination
Use careful coordination between router and cells:

1. **Control plane migration** - Migrate clients from one cell to another
2. **State transition** - Ensure state is ready before traffic routing
3. **Dependency minimization** - Avoid or minimize cross-cell dependencies
4. **Fault isolation** - Maintain isolation during migration process

### Benefits
- **Cleaner separation** - Avoids cross-cell dependencies
- **Better isolation** - Maintains fault boundaries during migration
- **Simpler rollback** - Easier to revert if migration fails
- **Predictable behavior** - More deterministic migration process

## Migration Strategies

### Big Bang Migration
- **Complete migration** - Move entire customer at once
- **Faster completion** - Shorter migration window
- **Higher risk** - All-or-nothing approach
- **Simpler coordination** - Single migration event

### Gradual Migration
- **Phased approach** - Move customer data/traffic incrementally
- **Lower risk** - Ability to validate each phase
- **Longer duration** - Extended migration timeline
- **Complex coordination** - Multiple migration phases to manage

### Canary Migration
- **Test subset** - Migrate small portion first
- **Validation** - Verify migration success before proceeding
- **Risk mitigation** - Identify issues early
- **Rollback capability** - Easy to revert test migration

## Migration Considerations

### Data Consistency
- **Consistency models** - Choose appropriate consistency guarantees
- **Conflict resolution** - Handle concurrent updates during migration
- **Validation mechanisms** - Ensure data integrity throughout process
- **Rollback procedures** - Ability to restore consistent state

### Performance Impact
- **Migration overhead** - Additional load during migration process
- **Customer impact** - Minimize performance degradation
- **Resource utilization** - Manage resource consumption during migration
- **Monitoring** - Track performance metrics throughout migration

### Operational Complexity
- **Automation requirements** - Minimize manual intervention
- **Monitoring and alerting** - Comprehensive visibility into migration status
- **Error handling** - Robust error recovery mechanisms
- **Documentation** - Clear procedures and runbooks

## Best Practices

### Design for Migration from Day One
- **Migration capability** - Build migration mechanisms early
- **State management** - Design for easy state transfer
- **Monitoring integration** - Include migration metrics in observability
- **Testing procedures** - Regular migration testing and validation

### Minimize Migration Frequency
- **Proper sizing** - Size cells appropriately to reduce migrations
- **Growth planning** - Anticipate customer growth patterns
- **Capacity management** - Maintain adequate headroom in cells
- **Load balancing** - Distribute load evenly to avoid hotspots

### Automation and Tooling
- **Automated migration** - Reduce manual intervention and errors
- **Validation tools** - Automated verification of migration success
- **Rollback automation** - Quick recovery from failed migrations
- **Monitoring dashboards** - Real-time visibility into migration progress

### Communication and Coordination
- **Customer communication** - Notify customers of planned migrations
- **Team coordination** - Ensure all teams are aware of migration activities
- **Change management** - Follow established change management procedures
- **Documentation** - Maintain detailed migration logs and procedures
