# AWS Labs cloudwatch MCP Server

An AWS Labs Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for CloudWatch provides AI-powered troubleshooting tools across metrics, alarms, and logs, enabling rapid root cause analysis and intelligent recommendations. It offers comprehensive observability tools that simplify monitoring, reduce context switching, and help teams quickly diagnose and resolve service issues. This server will provide AI agents and application developers with seamless access to CloudWatch telemetry data through standardized MCP interfaces, eliminating the need for custom API solutions and reducing context switching during troubleshooting workflows. By consolidating access to all CloudWatch capabilities, we enable powerful cross-service correlations and insights that accelerate incident resolution and improve operational visibility.

## Instructions

The CloudWatch MCP Server provides specialized tools to address common operational scenarios including alarm troubleshooting, understand metrics definitions, alarm recommendations and log analysis. Each tool encapsulates one or multiple CloudWatch APIs into task-oriented operations.

## Features

Alarm Based Troubleshooting - Identifies active alarms, retrieves related metrics and logs, and analyzes historical alarm patterns to determine root causes of triggered alerts. Provides context-aware recommendations for remediation.

Log Analyzer - Analyzes a CloudWatch log group for anomalies, message patterns, and error patterns within a specified time window.

Metric Definition Analyzer - Provides comprehensive descriptions of what metrics represent, how they're calculated, recommended statistics to use for metric data retrieval

Alarm Recommendations - Suggests optimal alarm configurations based on best practices. Helps reduce false positives and ensure appropriate coverage of critical metrics.

## Prerequisites

1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
2. Install Python using `uv python install 3.10`
3. An AWS account with [CloudWatch Telemetry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)
4. This MCP server can only be run locally on the same host as your LLM client.
5. Set up AWS credentials with access to AWS services
   - You need an AWS account with appropriate permissions
   - Configure AWS credentials with `aws configure` or environment variables

Example for Amazon Q Developer CLI (~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "[The AWS Profile Name to use for AWS access]",
        "AWS_REGION": "[The AWS region to run in]",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "transportType": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

### Build and install docker image locally on the same host of your LLM client

1. `git clone https://github.com/awslabs/mcp.git`
2. Go to sub-directory 'src/cloudwatch-mcp-server/'
3. Run 'docker build -t awslabs/cloudwatch-mcp-server:latest .'

### Add or update your LLM client's config with following:
```file
# fictitious `.env` file with AWS temporary credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<from the profile you set up>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<from the profile you set up>
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<from the profile you set up>
```

```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "awslabs.amazon-kendra-index-mcp-server": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
