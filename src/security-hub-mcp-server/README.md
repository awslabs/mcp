# Security Hub MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for analyzing security findings in AWS Security Hub.

You can analyze your issues with prompts like:

> Identify the most important issues in Security Hub for AWS account ID 12345679012. Security Hub is enabled in region us-east-1.

Or filter by severity:

> What are the Security Hub issues with severity critical in account 12345679012?

## Possible Next Steps

The near term goal is to make the `get_findings` tool more useful and reliable.

For utility, this includes:

* support filtering issues by date created/updated/observed or criticality
* see if we can open up querying with user-supplied filters, because the [set of supported Security Hub issue filters is massive](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/securityhub/client/get_findings.html)
* support pagination and limits on maximum number of issues retrieved

For reliablity, this may include:

* creating instructions and tools (to generate prompts) so that the intended issues are selected

Contributions welcome!
