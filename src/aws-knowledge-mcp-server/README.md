# Configure AWS MCP:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-knowledge-mcp": {
      "url": "https://awsdocumentationmcpalphagateway-gh6onmmp4q.gateway.gamma.us-east-1.genesis-primitives.aws.dev/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

###  Using Claude Code (Free tier not available)
1. Install Claude Code (requires nodejs 18+)
  - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. Add AWS MCP Server to Claude Code
  - `claude mcp add --transport http aws-knowledge-mcp https://awsdocumentationmcpalphagateway-gh6onmmp4q.gateway.gamma.us-east-1.genesis-primitives.aws.dev/mcp`
3. Start claude code and chat with claude about your AWS account
  - `claude`
4. Verify that the MCP server is connected
  - `/mcp`
5. You should see `aws-knowledge-mcp` in the list and its connection status

### Testing and Troubleshooting
If you want to call Knowledge MCP directly, not through an LLM, you can do so using MCP Inspector. It gives you a UI where you can do tools/list and tools/call with arbitrary parameters.

### AWS Authentication

The Knowledge MCP server does not require authentication but is subject to rate limits.
