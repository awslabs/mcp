## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Preserve non-ASCII (e.g. CJK, accented, emoji) text in `QueryKnowledgeBases` and `ListKnowledgeBases` tool results by serializing with `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)`, so Knowledge Base content reaches the model and user as readable characters instead of `\uXXXX` escape sequences.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-26

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Server Sent Events (SSE) support has been removed in accordance with the Model Context Protocol specification's [backwards compatibility guidelines](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#backwards-compatibility)
