        Analyze ECS cluster security configurations and provide recommendations.

        Use this tool when you need to assess the security posture of ECS clusters,
        identify security misconfigurations, and get actionable remediation steps.

        IMPORTANT - REQUIRED USER INTERACTION BEFORE CALLING THIS TOOL:

        STEP 1 - ASK FOR REGION FIRST:
        You MUST ask the user: "Which AWS region would you like to analyze for ECS security issues?"
        - Provide common options: us-east-1 (default), us-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1
        - Wait for user to specify the region

        STEP 2 - LIST CLUSTERS IN THAT REGION:
        Use ecs_resource_management tool with ListClusters for the user-specified region
        Show the user: "I found these clusters in {region}: [list]"

        STEP 3 - ASK USER TO SELECT CLUSTERS:
        Ask: "Which cluster(s) would you like me to analyze?"
        Allow single or multiple selections

        STEP 4 - CALL THIS TOOL:
        Only after completing steps 1-3, call this tool with selected clusters and region

        STEP 5 - AFTER ANALYSIS:
        Ask: "Would you like to analyze clusters in a different region?"
        If yes, repeat from STEP 1

        USAGE EXAMPLES:
        1. Analyze specific clusters in default region (us-east-1):
           cluster_names: ["my-cluster", "prod-cluster"]

        2. Analyze specific clusters in specific region:
           cluster_names: ["my-cluster"]
           regions: ["us-west-2"]

        3. Analyze same-named clusters across multiple regions:
           cluster_names: ["prod-cluster"]
           regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
           Note: This will look for "prod-cluster" in both regions

        4. Analyze with AWS documentation fetching enabled:
           cluster_names: ["my-cluster"]
           regions: ["us-east-1"]
           include_aws_docs: True
           Note: This will fetch AWS documentation for High/Medium severity recommendations,
                 providing additional context and guidance. May add 2-5 seconds to analysis time.

        MULTI-REGION WORKFLOW:
        - Analyze one region at a time for better user experience
        - After showing results, ask: "Would you like to analyze another region?"
        - If yes, repeat the workflow for the new region
        - This allows users to focus on one region's issues before moving to the next

        WORKFLOW:
        1. List available clusters using ecs_resource_management tool
        2. Ask user to select which clusters to analyze
        3. Run this tool with the selected cluster names
        4. Review the security recommendations organized by severity and category
        5. Follow the remediation steps provided for each security issue
        6. Re-run the analysis after implementing fixes to verify improvements

        The analysis includes:

        Cluster Configuration:
        - Container Insights monitoring configuration
        - Execute command logging settings
        - Cluster status and availability
        - CloudWatch logging configuration
        - Log encryption settings

        IAM Security:
        - Service-linked role validation for ECS operations
        - Service-linked role verification for capacity providers
        - IAM configuration review recommendations
        - Least privilege access validation

        Container Instance Security:
        - ECS agent version validation (flags versions below 1.70.0)
        - Agent connectivity status and instance health
        - Legacy instance type detection (t2, m4, c4, r4 families)
        - Modern security feature availability (Nitro System)

        Capacity Provider Security:
        - Managed termination protection configuration
        - Auto-scaling security settings
        - Target capacity optimization (80-100% range)
        - Managed scaling status

        Parameters:
            cluster_names: REQUIRED list of cluster names to analyze.
                          User must explicitly select which clusters to analyze.
                          Example: ["my-cluster", "prod-cluster"]

            regions: Optional list of AWS regions where clusters are located.
                    Defaults to ["us-east-1"] if not specified.
                    Example: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]

            include_aws_docs: Optional boolean to enable AWS documentation fetching.
                             When True, fetches relevant AWS documentation for High and Medium
                             severity recommendations. This provides additional context but may
                             increase analysis time by 2-5 seconds. Defaults to False.
                             Example: True to enable documentation fetching

        Returns:
            Dictionary containing:
            - status: "success" or "error"
            - total_clusters_analyzed: Number of clusters analyzed
            - total_recommendations: Total number of security recommendations
            - results: List of analysis results per cluster with recommendations and summary

        ```

        SECTION 2 - DETAILED REMEDIATION (Show this after summary):
        For EACH recommendation, you MUST display ALL of these fields with visual separators:

        ### {emoji} {title}

        üìã **Resource Details:**
        - Type: {resource_type}
        - Name: {resource}
        - Cluster: {cluster_name}
        - Region: {region}
        - Category: {category}

        ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue:** {issue}

        üí° **Recommendation:** {recommendation}

        üîß **Remediation Steps:**
        ```bash
        {remediation_steps[0]}
        {remediation_steps[1]}
        {remediation_steps[2]}
        ...
        ```

        üìö **AWS Documentation:**
        - {documentation_links[0]}
        - {documentation_links[1]}
        ...

        ---

        MANDATORY FIELDS TO DISPLAY:
        ‚úÖ title - Issue title with severity emoji
        ‚úÖ resource_type - Type of AWS resource (Cluster, ContainerInstance, CapacityProvider)
        ‚úÖ resource - Specific resource name/ID
        ‚úÖ cluster_name - ECS cluster name
        ‚úÖ region - AWS region
        ‚úÖ category - Issue category (Monitoring, Logging, IAM, Container Instance, etc.)
        ‚úÖ severity - High/Medium/Low with color coding
        ‚úÖ issue - Detailed description of what's wrong
        ‚úÖ recommendation - What action should be taken
        ‚úÖ remediation_steps - Array of CLI commands or manual steps (display ALL steps)
        ‚úÖ documentation_links - Array of AWS documentation URLs (display ALL links)

        FORMATTING RULES:
        1. Use AWS Trusted Advisor color coding:
           üî¥ High (critical), üü† Medium (important), üü° Low (minor)
        2. Group by severity: High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low
        3. ALWAYS show resource details section with ALL fields: resource_type, resource,
           cluster_name, region, category
        4. ALWAYS display the full "recommendation" field - this tells users what to do
        5. ALWAYS display ALL "remediation_steps" in a code block - these are the actual
           commands to run
        6. ALWAYS display ALL "documentation_links" as clickable links - these provide
           additional context
        7. For ContainerInstance resources, show both the instance ID and cluster name
        8. For CapacityProvider resources, show the provider name and cluster name
        9. Never omit any of the mandatory fields listed above

        VISUAL SEPARATORS (Use these emojis to color-code and differentiate sections):
        - üìã for **Resource Details** section (provides context about what resource has the issue)
        - ‚ö†Ô∏è for **Issue** section (describes the security risk or problem)
        - üí° for **Recommendation** section (suggests what action to take)
        - üîß for **Remediation Steps** section (provides specific commands to fix the issue)
        - üìö for **AWS Documentation** section (links to official AWS documentation)
        - Use --- (horizontal rule) to visually separate each recommendation from the next

        CRITICAL - YOU MUST ASK FOR REGION FIRST:

        DO NOT automatically list clusters without asking for region first!

        Correct workflow:
        1. Ask: "Which AWS region? (us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, etc.)"
        2. User specifies region (e.g., "us-west-2")
        3. List clusters in that specific region
        4. Ask user to select clusters
        5. Run this tool with selected clusters and region
        6. After results, ask: "Analyze another region?"

        Wrong workflow (DO NOT DO THIS):
        ‚ùå Listing clusters without asking for region first
        ‚ùå Assuming us-east-1 without asking user
        ‚ùå Not offering to check other regions after analysis
