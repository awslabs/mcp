# Prompts for ECS Security Analysis Scenario

## Expected Observed Behavior
When running 02_validate.sh, you should see output similar to:
```
✅ Test cluster 'llm-test-security-cluster' found
✅ Test ECS infrastructure created successfully
   • Cluster: llm-test-security-cluster
   • Region: us-east-1
   • Task Definition: llm-test-security-task
   • Security Issues: Intentionally configured for testing
```

## Test Prompts

# Prompt 1: General Security Assessment
I have an ECS cluster called "llm-test-security-cluster" in us-east-1. Can you help me analyze its security posture and identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations?

# Prompt 2: Compliance-Focused Query
I need to ensure my ECS cluster "llm-test-security-cluster" meets security compliance standards. Can you check it against common frameworks like AWS security best practices and provide a compliance report?

# Prompt 3: Specific Security Concerns
I'm concerned about container security in my ECS cluster "llm-test-security-cluster". Can you analyze the task definitions and container configurations for security issues like privileged containers or hardcoded secrets?

# Prompt 4: Beginner Security Question
I'm new to ECS security and want to make sure my cluster "llm-test-security-cluster" is secure. Can you explain what security issues I should be looking for and help me identify any problems?

# Prompt 5: Remediation-Focused Query
I know there might be security issues in my ECS cluster "llm-test-security-cluster". Can you not only identify the problems but also provide specific recommendations on how to fix them?

# Prompt 6: Multi-Turn Conversation Starter
Can you list all my ECS clusters and help me choose one for a security analysis?

# Prompt 7: Report Generation Request
I need a comprehensive security report for my ECS cluster "llm-test-security-cluster" that I can share with my security team. Can you generate a detailed report with findings and recommendations?

# Prompt 8: Framework-Specific Compliance
Can you check my ECS cluster "llm-test-security-cluster" against PCI-DSS compliance requirements and tell me what needs to be fixed?

IMPORTANT: The cluster name "llm-test-security-cluster" should be used consistently across all prompts as this is the test cluster created by the scenario.

## Expected Security Issues to be Found:
1. **Privileged Container**: Task definition has privileged=true
2. **Root User**: Container running as root user
3. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Environment variables contain hardcoded secrets
4. **Missing Execute Command Logging**: Cluster has logging disabled
5. **Network Security**: Potential network configuration issues
