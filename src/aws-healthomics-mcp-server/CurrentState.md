I've created all the files and content for Phase 1 of the AWS HealthOmics MCP Server implementation. Here's a summary of what I've done:

1. Core Infrastructure:
   • Updated consts.py with constants for workflow types, storage types, run statuses, etc.
   • Created models.py with Pydantic models for request/response validation
   • Updated server.py to register all the tools and import the necessary modules

2. Utility Modules:
   • Created utils/aws_utils.py for AWS session management and base64 encoding/decoding
   • Created utils/s3_utils.py for S3 operations like parsing URIs and uploading/downloading files
   • Created utils/wdl_utils.py for WDL validation and parameter extraction

3. Tool Implementations:
   • Created tools/workflow_management.py for workflow creation and management
   • Created tools/workflow_execution.py for running and monitoring workflows
   • Created tools/workflow_analysis.py for analyzing workflow performance
   • Created tools/troubleshooting.py for diagnosing workflow failures
   • Created tools/helper_tools.py for packaging workflows and generating parameter templates

4. Server Configuration:
   • Updated the server with proper instructions and dependencies
   • Registered all tools with the MCP server

The implementation follows the design document we created earlier and provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with AWS HealthOmics. The code is structured in a modular way, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Next steps would be:
1. Write unit tests for the functionality
2. Update the README.md with usage instructions
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Implement additional features as needed
