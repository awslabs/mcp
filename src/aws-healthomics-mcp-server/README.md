## Instructions for AI Assistants

This MCP server enables AI assistants to help users with AWS HealthOmics genomic workflow management. Here's how to effectively use these tools:

### Understanding AWS HealthOmics

AWS HealthOmics is designed for genomic data analysis workflows. Key concepts:

- **Workflows**: Computational pipelines written in WDL, CWL, or Nextflow that process genomic data
- **Runs**: Executions of workflows with specific input parameters and data
- **Tasks**: Individual steps within a workflow run
- **Storage Types**: STATIC (fixed storage) or DYNAMIC (auto-scaling storage)

### Workflow Management Best Practices

1. **Creating Workflows**:
   - **From local files**: Use `PackageAHOWorkflow` to bundle workflow files, then use the base64-encoded ZIP with `CreateAHOWorkflow`
   - **From S3**: Store your workflow definition ZIP file in S3 and reference it using the `definition_uri` parameter
   - Validate workflows with appropriate language syntax (WDL, CWL, Nextflow)
   - Include parameter templates to guide users on required inputs
   - Choose the appropriate method based on your workflow storage preferences

2. **S3 URI Support**:
   - Both `CreateAHOWorkflow` and `CreateAHOWorkflowVersion` support S3 URIs as an alternative to base64-encoded ZIP files
   - **Benefits of S3 URIs**:
     - Better for large workflow definitions (no base64 encoding overhead)
     - Easier integration with CI/CD pipelines that store artifacts in S3
     - Reduced memory usage during workflow creation
     - Direct reference to existing S3-stored workflow definitions
   - **Requirements**:
     - S3 URI must start with `s3://`
     - The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the HealthOmics service
     - Appropriate S3 permissions must be configured for the HealthOmics service
   - **Usage**: Specify either `definition_zip_base64` OR `definition_uri`, but not both

3. **Version Management**:
   - Create new versions for workflow updates rather than modifying existing ones
   - Use descriptive version names that indicate changes or improvements
   - List versions to help users choose the appropriate one
   - Both base64 ZIP and S3 URI methods are supported for version creation

### Workflow Execution Guidance

1. **Starting Runs**:
   - Always specify required parameters: workflow_id, role_arn, name, output_uri
   - Choose appropriate storage type (DYNAMIC recommended for most cases)
   - Use meaningful run names for easy identification
   - Configure caching when appropriate to save costs and time

2. **Monitoring Runs**:
   - Use `ListAHORuns` with status filters to track active workflows
   - Check individual run details with `GetAHORun` for comprehensive status
   - Monitor tasks with `ListAHORunTasks` to identify bottlenecks

### Troubleshooting Failed Runs

When workflows fail, follow this diagnostic approach:

1. **Start with DiagnoseAHORunFailure**: This comprehensive tool provides:
   - Failure reasons and error analysis
   - Failed task identification
   - Log summaries and recommendations
   - Actionable troubleshooting steps

2. **Access Specific Logs**:
   - **Run Logs**: High-level workflow events and status changes
   - **Engine Logs**: Workflow engine STDOUT/STDERR for system-level issues
   - **Task Logs**: Individual task execution details for specific failures
   - **Manifest Logs**: Resource utilization and workflow summary information

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Use `AnalyzeAHORunPerformance` to identify resource bottlenecks
   - Review task resource utilization patterns
   - Optimize workflow parameters based on analysis results

### Workflow Linting and Validation

The MCP server includes built-in workflow linting capabilities for validating WDL and CWL workflows before deployment:

1. **Lint Workflow Definitions**:
   - **Single files**: Use `LintAHOWorkflowDefinition` for individual workflow files
   - **Multi-file bundles**: Use `LintAHOWorkflowBundle` for workflows with imports and dependencies
   - **Syntax errors**: Catch parsing issues before deployment
   - **Missing components**: Identify missing inputs, outputs, or steps
   - **Runtime requirements**: Ensure tasks have proper runtime specifications
   - **Import resolution**: Validate imports and dependencies between files
   - **Best practices**: Get warnings about potential improvements

2. **Supported Formats**:
   - **WDL**: Uses miniwdl for comprehensive validation
   - **CWL**: Uses cwltool for standards-compliant validation

3. **No Additional Installation Required**:
   Both miniwdl and cwltool are included as dependencies and available immediately after installing the MCP server.

### Genomics File Discovery

The MCP server includes a powerful genomics file search tool that helps users locate and discover genomics files across multiple storage systems:

1. **Multi-Storage Search**:
   - **S3 Buckets**: Search configured S3 bucket paths for genomics files
   - **HealthOmics Sequence Stores**: Discover read sets and their associated files
   - **HealthOmics Reference Stores**: Find reference genomes and associated indexes
   - **Unified Results**: Get combined, deduplicated results from all storage systems

2. **Intelligent Pattern Matching**:
   - **File Path Matching**: Search against S3 object keys and HealthOmics resource names
   - **Tag-Based Search**: Match against S3 object tags and HealthOmics metadata
   - **Fuzzy Matching**: Find files even with partial or approximate search terms
   - **Multiple Terms**: Support for multiple search terms with logical matching

3. **Automatic File Association**:
   - **BAM/CRAM Indexes**: Automatically group BAM files with their .bai indexes and CRAM files with .crai indexes
   - **FASTQ Pairs**: Detect and group R1/R2 read pairs using standard naming conventions (_R1/_R2, _1/_2)
   - **FASTA Indexes**: Associate FASTA files with their .fai, .dict, and BWA index collections
   - **Variant Indexes**: Group VCF/GVCF files with their .tbi and .csi index files
   - **Complete File Sets**: Identify complete genomics file collections for analysis pipelines

4. **Smart Relevance Scoring**:
   - **Pattern Match Quality**: Higher scores for exact matches, lower for fuzzy matches
   - **File Type Relevance**: Boost scores for files matching the requested type
   - **Associated Files Bonus**: Increase scores for files with complete index sets
   - **Storage Accessibility**: Consider storage class (Standard vs. Glacier) in scoring

5. **Comprehensive File Metadata**:
   - **Access Paths**: S3 URIs or HealthOmics S3 access point paths for direct data access
   - **File Characteristics**: Size, storage class, last modified date, and file type detection
   - **Storage Information**: Archive status and retrieval requirements
   - **Source System**: Clear indication of whether files are from S3, sequence stores, or reference stores

6. **Configuration and Setup**:
   - **S3 Bucket Configuration**: Set `GENOMICS_SEARCH_S3_BUCKETS` environment variable with comma-separated bucket paths
   - **Example**: `GENOMICS_SEARCH_S3_BUCKETS=s3://my-genomics-data/,s3://shared-references/hg38/`
   - **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate S3 and HealthOmics read permissions
   - **Performance**: Parallel searches across storage systems for optimal response times

7. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - **Smart S3 API Usage**: Optimized to minimize S3 API calls by 60-90% through intelligent caching and batching
   - **Lazy Tag Loading**: Only retrieves S3 object tags when needed for pattern matching
   - **Result Caching**: Caches search results to eliminate repeated S3 calls for identical searches
   - **Batch Operations**: Retrieves tags for multiple objects in parallel batches
   - **Configurable Performance**: Tune cache TTLs, batch sizes, and tag search behavior for your use case
   - **Path-First Matching**: Prioritizes file path matching over tag matching to reduce API calls

### File Search Usage Examples

1. **Find FASTQ Files for a Sample**:
   ```
   User: "Find all FASTQ files for sample NA12878"
   ‚Üí Use SearchGenomicsFiles with file_type="fastq" and search_terms=["NA12878"]
   ‚Üí Returns R1/R2 pairs automatically grouped together
   ‚Üí Includes file sizes and storage locations
   ```

2. **Locate Reference Genomes**:
   ```
   User: "Find human reference genome hg38 files"
   ‚Üí Use SearchGenomicsFiles with file_type="fasta" and search_terms=["hg38", "human"]
   ‚Üí Returns FASTA files with associated .fai, .dict, and BWA indexes
   ‚Üí Provides S3 access point paths for HealthOmics reference stores
   ```

3. **Search for Alignment Files**:
   ```
   User: "Find BAM files from the 1000 Genomes project"
   ‚Üí Use SearchGenomicsFiles with file_type="bam" and search_terms=["1000", "genomes"]
   ‚Üí Returns BAM files with their .bai index files
   ‚Üí Ranked by relevance with complete file metadata
   ```

4. **Discover Variant Files**:
   ```

   ‚Üí Returns VCF files with associated .tbi index files
   ‚Üí Includes both S3 and HealthOmics store results
   ```

### Performance Tuning for File Search

The genomics file search includes several optimizations to minimize S3 API calls and improve performance:

1. **For Path-Based Searches** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Use specific file/sample names in search terms
   # This enables path matching without tag retrieval
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_ENABLE_S3_TAG_SEARCH=true  # Keep enabled for fallback
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_RESULT_CACHE_TTL=600       # Cache results for 10 minutes
   ```

2. **For Tag-Heavy Environments**:
   ```bash
   # Optimize batch sizes for your dataset
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_MAX_TAG_BATCH_SIZE=200     # Larger batches for better performance
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_TAG_CACHE_TTL=900          # Longer tag cache for frequently accessed objects
   ```

3. **For Cost-Sensitive Environments**:
   ```bash
   # Disable tag search if only path matching is needed
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_ENABLE_S3_TAG_SEARCH=false  # Eliminates all tag API calls
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_RESULT_CACHE_TTL=1800       # Longer result cache to reduce repeated searches
   ```

4. **For Development/Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Disable caching for immediate results during development
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_RESULT_CACHE_TTL=0         # No result caching
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_TAG_CACHE_TTL=0            # No tag caching
   GENOMICS_SEARCH_MAX_TAG_BATCH_SIZE=50      # Smaller batches for testing
   ```

**Performance Impact**: These optimizations can reduce S3 API calls by 60-90% and improve search response times by 5-10x compared to the unoptimized implementation.

### Common Use Cases
