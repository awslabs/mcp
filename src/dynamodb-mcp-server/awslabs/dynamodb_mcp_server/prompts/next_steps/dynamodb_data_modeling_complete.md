## Next Steps

Data modeling complete! Choose your next action:

**Validate the model** (recommended) - Test all access patterns against DynamoDB Local to verify your design works correctly. To validate, say "validate my data model" or "run validation".

**Generate Python code** - Skip validation and generate type-safe entities and repositories immediately. To generate code, say "generate code" or "convert to schema.json".
