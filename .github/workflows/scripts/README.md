# Automated Code Owner Assignment System

This directory contains an automated system for assigning code owners to unassigned issues in the awslabs/mcp repository based on the CODEOWNERS file and intelligent content analysis.

## üìã Overview

The system consists of three main components:

1. **`assign_code_owners.py`** - Main assignment script with intelligent server detection
2. **`mcp_github_client.py`** - GitHub MCP server integration wrapper
3. **`auto-assign-issues.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automation

## üéØ Key Features

- **Intelligent Assignment**: Uses content analysis to detect which MCP server(s) an issue relates to
- **CODEOWNERS Integration**: Automatically assigns based on the repository's CODEOWNERS file
- **Automated Scheduling**: Runs daily via GitHub Actions to handle all unassigned issues
- **Real-time Assignment**: Assigns new issues as soon as they're created
- **Project Board Integration**: Automatically adds assigned issues to the GitHub project board
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs and summary reports for audit purposes
- **Dry-run Support**: Test assignments without making actual changes

## üîß How It Works

### Assignment Logic

1. **Server Detection**: Analyzes issue title, body, and labels for:
   - Direct server name mentions (e.g., "aws-api-mcp-server")
   - Path references (e.g., "/src/dynamodb-mcp-server")
   - Service keywords (e.g., "dynamodb" ‚Üí "dynamodb-mcp-server")
   - Label patterns (e.g., "dynamodb-mcp-server" label)

2. **Owner Mapping**: Maps detected servers to code owners from CODEOWNERS file:
   - Single server ‚Üí assign to specific maintainers
   - Multiple servers ‚Üí assign to all relevant maintainers
   - No specific server ‚Üí assign to @awslabs/mcp-maintainers (fallback)

3. **Assignment**: Updates GitHub issue with:
   - Individual assignees (filtered from team mentions)
   - Explanatory comment with assignment reasoning
   - Addition to GitHub project board

### Automation Schedule

- **Daily**: 9:00 UTC - processes all unassigned issues
- **On Issue Creation**: Immediately assigns new issues
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be run on-demand with custom options

## üöÄ Setup

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with CODEOWNERS file
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Docker available (for GitHub MCP server)

### Installation

1. **Files are already created** - The system is ready to use
2. **GitHub Actions will install dependencies automatically**
3. **No additional setup required** - uses repository secrets

### Configuration

The system uses these environment variables:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN         # GitHub personal access token (automatic in Actions)
GITHUB_PROJECT_URL   # Project board URL (set in workflow)
DRY_RUN              # Enable dry-run mode (workflow input)
VERBOSE              # Enable verbose logging (workflow input)
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

# Set required environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"

# Run in dry-run mode to see what would happen
python scripts/assign_code_owners.py --dry-run --verbose

# Run actual assignments
python scripts/assign_code_owners.py --verbose
```

### GitHub Actions Triggers

1. **Scheduled Run**: Automatically runs daily at 9:00 UTC
2. **Manual Trigger**: Go to Actions ‚Üí "Auto-Assign Code Owners to Issues" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
3. **New Issue**: Automatically runs when new issues are created

## üìä Server Detection Patterns

The system detects MCP servers using these patterns:

| Pattern Type | Example | Result |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Direct mention | "aws-api-mcp-server" | aws-api-mcp-server |
| Service keyword | "dynamodb issue" | dynamodb-mcp-server |
| Path reference | "/src/eks-mcp-server" | eks-mcp-server |
| Label pattern | Label: "cdk-mcp-server" | cdk-mcp-server |

## üë• Assignment Examples

### Single Server Issue
```
Title: "DynamoDB MCP Server connection timeout"
‚Üí Detected: dynamodb-mcp-server
‚Üí Assigned to: @erbenmo, @shetsa-amzn, @LeeroyHannigan
```

### Multiple Server Issue
```
Title: "Integration between CDK and Terraform MCP servers"
‚Üí Detected: cdk-mcp-server, terraform-mcp-server
‚Üí Assigned to: @jimini55, @alexa-perlov
```

### General Issue
```
Title: "Documentation improvements needed"
‚Üí Detected: (none specific)
‚Üí Assigned to: @awslabs/mcp-maintainers
```

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logs and Reports

- **GitHub Actions Summary**: View assignment results in workflow summary
- **Detailed Logs**: Full verbose logs available in workflow runs
- **Failure Notifications**: Automatic issue creation if scheduled runs fail

### Updating Server Patterns

To add new MCP servers or update detection patterns:

1. **Update CODEOWNERS file** - Add new server entries
2. **Update `_build_server_patterns()`** - Add keyword mappings
3. **Update `_parse_codeowners()`** - Add owner mappings
4. **Test changes** - Run with `--dry-run --verbose`

### Monitoring Health

The system includes several monitoring mechanisms:

- **Failure Detection**: Creates issues when scheduled runs fail
- **Assignment Tracking**: Logs all assignment decisions
- **Coverage Reports**: Shows which issues couldn't be assigned to specific servers

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: Uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary GitHub permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All assignments are logged and commented on issues
- **Safe Defaults**: Falls back to maintainers for unclear cases

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Connection Failed**
   - Check Docker is available in GitHub Actions
   - Verify GitHub token permissions
   - Check MCP server image availability

2. **No Issues Assigned**
   - Verify search query returns results
   - Check CODEOWNERS file format
   - Review server detection patterns

3. **Assignment Failures**
   - Check individual usernames exist
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Review GitHub API rate limits

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test server detection only
python scripts/assign_code_owners.py --dry-run --verbose

# Check MCP server connectivity
docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# Manually test specific issue
# (modify script to accept --issue-number parameter)
```
